        <!-- <h2>Students who want to work with me</h2>
        <p><strong>Undergrad/Master students:</strong> If you would like to work with me, you will need to know a few things. First, you will most likey join an existing projects lead by someone else, so you should be comfortable working with someone else. Second, I expect you to commit more than 10 hours of effort per week on research and I want you think percisely on when you can pull these hours out from your current schedule. Now these hours are just a proxy to the expecttion. At the end, it's about the output. That gets to my next point,    </p> -->
